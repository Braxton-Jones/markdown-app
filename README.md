# Personal Markdown Editor - MERN Stack
## Overview

This is a personal Markdown editor I created using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and editing Markdown documents. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text using easy-to-read and easy-to-write syntax. This project enables you to write and preview Markdown content in real-time.

### Features

- Real-time Markdown preview
- Rich text editor with syntax highlighting
- Document management with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations
- Responsive design for various devices
